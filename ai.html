Also internally built a tool that helped take data from various places to a single destination for its working and demonstration. The project was a part of my paid internship. After this project, I understood the end-to-end workflow of Analysis in a CA firm.</p>

The NiV is considered to be the next deadly virus after COVID, and this study helped me understand how data science and ML algorithms can be used to trace and understand the working of past data. Manual scraping of the data from various resources was done. Its published in the IJRASET journal.</p>

In this, it was an abstract dataset given with lot of cleaning and pre-processing required. I also performed some feature engineering to understand how the internal logic is actually working. As a kick-start to the understanding of the PowerBI, this project was a bang-on experience, adding to the fact that I also had to present a video of demonstration.</p>

The UI makes used of streamlit. The project started right from the data availability and ended with prediction. I have also developed an NLP model with keyword boosting, but since it is a bit heavy-weight, I have not put it there. Connect with me to understand the best about this project.</p>
